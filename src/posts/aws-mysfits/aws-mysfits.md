## AWS Modern Web Application 

At Unisys, I had a few senior co-workers who have gotten interested in AWS and how they are using
Cloud services for so many things. My co-worker decided to take some time and set up a workshop for
other team members and used the AWS Modern Application Workshop to guide us.

The workshop is called AWS Modern Application Workshop and it went over a majority of the services AWS provides. The list of resouces we created and used during the workshop uses are as follows:

* AWS Kinesis
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon S3
* Amazon API Gateway
* Amazon Cognito
* AWS CodePipeline
* AWS CodeBuild
* AWS CodeCommit
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon ECS
* Amazon EC2
* Amazon VPC
* AWS IAM
* AWS CloudFormation
* Amazon CloudFront

I chose the Python route and was very impressed on all the features AWS has to offer. It was a great learning experience and it really motivated me to hopefully deploy my own webpage on AWS.
