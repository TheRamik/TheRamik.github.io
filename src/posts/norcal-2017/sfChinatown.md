## Norcal Trip
It was closer to winter break. Took a trip to norcal for a bit for Thanksgiving. The drive up and down from Irvine, California to San Jose was the most exhausting thing from the trip. This was also a very memorable trip. Great times with great vibes!

## Location
1. Milpitas
2. San Jose
3. San Francisco

### Milpitas
It was a good time at Milpitas! Didn't know Safeway was a thing! Never seen one in SoCal.

### San Jose
Was able to see a good friend Andrew. He hooked it up with some of that housemade dish. I'll keep it a secret until he releases it.

### San Francisco 
My fourth time going to San Francisco, but this time I chilled mainly at Chinatown. The Chinese culture in San Francisco is there!
