I just started to learn GatsbyJS. I created this web page with GatsbyJS

## Topics Covered

1. Gatsby
2. GraphQL
3. Slug

## Gatsby

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

Gatsby is able to pull data sources from multiple places. One being Markdown text. The current blog posts are all done in markdown text files!

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with the exisiting data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in the API. 

Gatsby uses GraphQL to grab these information. The current blog posts are retrieved using GraphQL as we can define the title and the date of the post in the markdown text file and have GraphQL retrieve these data. Then the rest of text in the file can be tranformed into HTML format and placed into the blog post as an HTML.

## Slug

A Slug is the part of a URL which identifies a particular page on a website in a easy to read form. 

The blogs created here are all using slugs to form the URL for the blog posts. A very cool plugin that Gatsby has!
