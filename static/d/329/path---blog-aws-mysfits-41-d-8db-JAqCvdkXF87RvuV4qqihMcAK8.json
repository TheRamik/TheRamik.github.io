{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Modern Web Application on AWS","date":"2019-05-10"},"html":"<h2>AWS Modern Web Application</h2>\n<p>At Unisys, I had a few senior co-workers who have gotten interested in AWS and how they are using\nCloud services for so many things. My co-worker decided to take some time and set up a workshop for\nother team members and used the AWS Modern Application Workshop to guide us.</p>\n<p>AWS Modern Web Application <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modern-application-workshop\">Link</a></p>\n<p>The workshop is called AWS Modern Application Workshop and it went over a majority of the services AWS provides. The list of resouces we created and used during the workshop uses are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Kinesis</li>\n<li>AWS Lambda</li>\n<li>Amazon S3</li>\n<li>Amazon API Gateway</li>\n<li>Amazon Cognito</li>\n<li>AWS CodePipeline</li>\n<li>AWS CodeBuild</li>\n<li>AWS CodeCommit</li>\n<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li>\n<li>Amazon ECS</li>\n<li>Amazon EC2</li>\n<li>Amazon VPC</li>\n<li>AWS IAM</li>\n<li>AWS CloudFormation</li>\n<li>Amazon CloudFront</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I chose the Python route and was very impressed on all the features AWS has to offer. It was a great learning experience and it really motivated me to hopefully deploy my own webpage on AWS. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"aws-mysfits"}}
